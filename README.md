# RobustGARCH_Matlab

The function ROBUSTGARCH provides the robust GARCH estimator of Boudt et al. (2013) using the modification proposed by Trucíos et al. (2017). The other functions are auxiliary ones.
The function is also implemented in the R package RobGARCHBoot (also available on GitHub). The functions' names were kept similar to the ones in the R implementation (for details about each auxiliary functions, see the R implementation).
